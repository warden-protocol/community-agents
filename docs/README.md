# Introduction

This documentation provides guides to help you get started with developing different types of agents.

To quickly start building with LangGraph, see the following guides:

- [Get started with TypeScript LangGraph agents](langgraph-quick-start.md)
- [Get started with Python LangGraph agents](langgraph-quick-start-py.md)

**Note**: These guides focus on the essentials: how to deploy and test your agent locally. If you'd rather skip setup details and dive straight into building real-world agent logic, check out the [Weather Agent example](../agents/weather-agent).

More content coming soon!
